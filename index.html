                        otherwise amazing city like Bangalore (can be extrapolated to other fast-growing cities of the
                        world). An average Bangalorean spends xmins everyday on the road, cursing his/her fate.
                        Additionally, y of the 15 most <span style="color: #c0392b ">polluted cities</span> in the world
                        are in India. We believe that adoption of public transport is key to solving the tyranny of
                        traffic and to ease pressure on the environent. We were wondering why we ourselves don't use
                        public transport and 3 key issues stood out - uncertainty around <span
                            style="color: #c0392b ">ETA</span>, uncertainty around <span
                            style="color: #c0392b ">occupancy/comfort</span>, uncertainty around <span
                            style="color: #c0392b ">last-mile connectivity</span>. We think that if we eliminate all the
                        3 barriers and provide a seamless Uber-like experience, public transport becomes a no-brainer,
                        given that it is already <span style="color: #c0392b ">5x-10x cheaper</span>. People are also
                        used to the seamless payment experience most ride-hailing services provide. We want to do

                            can be. We don't think it's entirely their fault. Same fares during peak and off-peak times
                            can be widely inefficient. So, they resort to driving up fares knowing fully well you

                            to align incentives of all parties. What if you could <span style="color: #c0392b ">scale haggling</span>? Meter Mélé (translated
                            from Kannada; means 'on top of the meter', a common way for drivers to ask for extra money
                            on top of the fare) is that solution. Customers enter the maximum Meter Mélé amount they are
                            willing to pay. This <span style="color: #c0392b ">bid is broadcast</span> to all nearby drivers starting from 0 to

                        We're The Bayesian Conspiracy. We were many different people at many different points of time, going by many different collective names. Currently we're Sreejith and Vivek. We're friends from IIT Kharagpur, based out of Bangalore. We love science, and we love programming and we love hackathons. We believe, as many people do, that technology is the tool with which we'll truly scale solutions to a global audience. In 2019 we've won 4/4 hackathons. We've built product hacks for messaging, insurance, interior design, decentralized trade, personal medication management and multimodal transportation. We've worked on technologies like Augmented Reality,  IoT, blockchain, Deep Learning, chatbots, voicebots etc. apart from the usual suspects (Node, React, Python etc). When not doing hackathons, we work on a host of personal side projects about things that amuse us or fight with each other about how to implement Universal Basic Income. With a combined 3+ years experience in the ride-hailing industry, we believe we can contribute to solving traffic and urban congestion :)

            <p class="sub-title">{What about these things, huh?}</p>
            <div class="coldiv" style="width:100%; margin-top: 30px">
                <p><b>1. How is this different from Google Maps?</b><br>
                    Saturn is basically Google Maps Navigation on steroids. Google Navigation does not mix travel modes in journeys, Saturn will - For example you might get a Metro and Bus travel in the same journey, if that's the most optimum choice. You will also get real time ETA of public transport, which is not there in Google currently. Also, Google has no idea about occupancy in public transport, which is vital to people adopting more buses/metros. Saturn also has an incentive aligning feature : Meter mele, which we believe is a crucial part this system working. Saturn is different from Google Maps because it is much much much more than Google Maps.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>2. How is this different from Uber/Ola?</b><br>
                    Saturn will fundamentally be open. Saturn will pay P2P; no obfuscation from drivers. Also, Saturn will drive traffic towards public transport, and not away from it. We aim to replace Uber/Ola wherever they make things inefficient and complement them where they are useful. We want Saturn to be very similar to the seamless Uber experience we're all used to, though :) 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>3. Isn't having a camera on a bus dangerous?</b><br>
                    We're as concerned of the Big Brother govt as you are. The deep learning module is privacy first - the evaluation will happen on the device and no image is ever uploaded. The code will also be in public domain.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>4. Aren't there too many moving parts here?</b><br>
                    Yes, this is a slightly ambitious plan. But Saturn is very modular. Apart from a few key features like ETA and occupancy, everything else (Like payments, govt apps, different public transport modes) can be plugged in, iteratively. If we get access to historical ticketing info, we can predict occupancy till the DL modules are deployed in every bus. Uber/Ola can be used for last mile connectivity till Meter Mele has widespread adoption from auto drivers. So, despite having many independent parts, they can be built iteratively. And Saturn still has great value with a subset of features.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>5. Can you both really complete this?</b><br>
                    We think so. We're fairly quick in getting MVPs out. We've worked on technologies like Augmented Reality,  IoT, blockchain, Deep Learning, chatbots, voicebots etc. apart from the usual suspects (Node, React, Python etc). We think we should be able to build most features except payments (that'll require interfacing with a bank and other legal shiz). Scheduling meetings with officials will be tricky, and we want to focus on this.
