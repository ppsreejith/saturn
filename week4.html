                <p>This was yet another incredible week, for us! We've finalized the pilot date with NEC, to be May
                    13th, 7 days from today. They're paying us <b>~$3500</b> for the pilot phase study; we're super
                    thrilled about that! We believe that trust is a fundamental aspect of ride-hailing. So, after
                    numerous rounds of talks with ICICI Bank, we've designed a trust-less framework using UPI 2.0
                    (mandates and promise of payment), which rewards good actors and penalizes bad actors on the
                    platform. We're flying down to Mumbai on May 14th, to demo the app (and the trust-less payments
                    framework) to top executives from ICICI, and a few VCs. Contingent on them accepting the solution,
                    they've agreed to pay us <b>~$7000</b> for our efforts during the POC (<b>taking us to ~$10.5K in
                        the green! :D</b>). </p><br><br>

                                small scale. We're hiring a few auto rickshaws to be on the platform. They've paid us
                                ~$3500 for the pilot study. The expected outcome of the study is to understand how users
                                view Saturn and to build a case to present to the Government of India, to install GPS in
                                all buses and to share real-time ticketing information.</p>

                            <p>Highlighted below is the framework we've designed. <b>TL;DR</b> : We use UPI mandates to
                                create payment promises from driver to the customer, and customer to the driver. If one
                                of them violates the contract (doesn't turn up, etc), then the other person gets the
                                money. Otherwise it is nullified. We believe that aligning monetary incentives with
                                future payment-promises will lead to the desired co-operative behaviour.</p><br>

                            <p>This document attempts to detail a trust-less payments system built over UPI 2.0 Mandates
                                for transport. Prerequisite information and current context has been added to aid
                                readers.</p><br>


                            <b>Current Customer-Driver interaction</b>

                                <li>Customers can find Rickshaws parked in a queue near bus/railway stations, popular
                                    locations etc.</li>
                                <li>They can also find Rickshaws by waving their hand at Rickshaws moving on the road to
                                    signal their intent to negotiate a journey.</li>
                                <li>A customer who wants to travel approaches the first Rickshaw and starts negotiating
                                    with the driver.</li>
                                <li>If negotiations fail, they move onto the next Rickshaw and resume their
                                    negotiations.</li>
                                <li>The customer travels in the first Rickshaw with which negotiations are successful.

                                <li>The bid is seen by drivers near the customer. On the driver’s app, they see the fare
                                    slowly rise over one minute from the standard meter fare to the maximum amount the
                                    user is willing to pay.</li>
                                <li>The first driver to accept the bid gets the bid and will arrive at the agreed upon
                                    pickup place to pick up the customer</li>
                                <li>After dropping off the customer, the customer pays the agreed upon price, and the
                                    trip ends.</li>

                            <b>Verifying Mandate Revocation/Execution</b><br>

                            If either the customer or the driver feels that they were wronged on a mandate, they can
                            prove to the
                            server that a given mandate was not executed fairly by sharing with the server the
                            parameters needed to
                            verify a transaction which the server can then use to verify the result of that transaction
                            and compare
                            against the required value.<br>


                            <br><b>Penalizing Invalid Mandate Revocation/Execution</b><br>

                            When penalizing a party for acting unfairly, the server can detect contract violations using
                            the method
                            above. If it detects there has been an unfair act committed, it penalizes the party in
                            question in the
                            following way:

                            1. It takes some amount from the security deposit of the cheating party and gives it to the
                            aggrieved
                            party.
                            2. It reduces the score of the cheating party which will reduce their chances of securing a
                            ride in the
                            future.<br>


                            <br><b>GPS Anomaly Detection</b><br>

                            By constantly tracking the GPS of the customer and driver, we can detect anomalies by
                            comparing their
                            GPS data against historical GPS data.
